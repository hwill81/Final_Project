1) Make sure to import all nedded modules
2) create class for Indevidual, Population, and Landscape

Indevidual:
-function that initializes indevidual and phenotype
-make a list of possible phenotypes

Population
-establish population size
- create list of populations by phenotypes
- sort each indevidual into a population
-print the frequencies of each phenotype/size of each pop

Landscape
-make a dispersal matrix
-randomly select whether to migrate or stay in current pop
- append populations after migration


4)Initialize parameters for scenario= which pop, pop size, migration freq
5)write function to gather data and print in string and plot
